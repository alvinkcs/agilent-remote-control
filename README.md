py3 is used in this tutorial. But python might work as well. Replace py as python.

1. install python packages 
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If python is used, then use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. set the Vgs (33120A)
```
py test8200.py
```
or
```
python test8200.py
```
3. set the Vds, delay time, etc.
```
py main.py
```
or 
```
python main.py
```
